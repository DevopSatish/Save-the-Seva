## Introduction

This project aims to address the issue of false charging and overcharging at public registration offices, government agencies, and educational institutions by developing a secure payment system. The system promotes online transactions, securely records and manages transactions, and ensures a hassle-free experience for users.

## Problem Statement

The issue of false charging or overcharging has been exacerbated due to increased reliance on offline cash transactions. The proposed solution focuses on secure transaction recording, efficient reconciliation, end-of-day fund transfers, and effective handling of cash payments.

## Scope and Analysis

Our proposed solution covers the payment architecture requirements to prevent false charging and encourage online transactions. It includes secure transaction recording, fund transfers, and effective handling of exceptions through cash payment.

## Objectives

- **Safeguard consumers against overcharging and ensure the security of their personal and financial information.**
- **Decrease the frequency and negative impact of digital payment fraud and overcharging on individuals, businesses, and financial institutions.**
- **Build consumer trust in the security of digital payment systems and promote the adoption of these technologies.**
- **Minimize the financial losses experienced by consumers, businesses, and financial institutions due to fraudulent activity.**
- **Develop and implement strategies and technologies aimed at preventing and mitigating payment fraud and establishing control over them.**
- **Collaborate with law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders to investigate and prosecute cases of payment fraud.**

## Key Features
